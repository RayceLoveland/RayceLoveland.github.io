The U.S. Civil War has been a haunting moment in the nation's history to this very day. Symbols of this time of history have left a challenging topic of the outlook of a great division in a country of unity. This brings up the topic of monuments and the split of honoring those who fought this tragic war. Confederate monuments have been a hot topic as of late, with movements calling for their takedown and those defending them. There is much controversy over the monuments that have been used to glorify those of the Confederacy and spread misinformation and a sense of dominance across the South, and even stretching outside to other parts of the country. However, to understand this issue (or ant issue), context and data are essential to grasp fully why there is such outrage about these monuments. That leads to the data source that will be reviewed here. This is an interactive database that shows vital information regarding Confederate monuments. Ranging from an interactive map to charts that provide the status of each known monument. This page was created through the University of Minnesota, but the data is tied to a different source. A URL to an article takes it to those who obtained the data from the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), a nonprofit organization. This article takes a stance on the topic and provides more data. We’ll review the source's stance, evidence, structure, and clarity. The SPLC has provided valuable data on an important topic, but some aspects raise concerns.
	The first thing to look at is the argument and interpretation of the data, which they very much did. This is mainly shown in the article portion of the source and is demonstrated through qualitative data. A discussion video also done by the SPLC talks about the difference between recognizing and celebrating history. While monuments honor a heritage, a common question and leading title of the article is whose heritage is honored. The interpretation, they argued, was that it neglected those whose ancestors suffered under the Confederate system. These are all common arguments that SPLC is countering with their interpretation. They further argue that White supremacists and other groups protect these monuments, which are being led by misinformation. This makes them point out that the Lost Cause and the myths it created still have an extensive impact today. All of it references personal instances of qualitative data, which we’ll discuss later. It conveys its argument instead well in that it is clear what its stance is from the start and that it sticks with its stance through and through. Although their argument was well put, it used data to build context for their interpretation of the situation.
The source used both quantitative and qualitative data effectively. The methodology was diverse and plentiful. They looked at Google Maps, state records, waymarking, and many more methods to confirm every monument of the Confederacy they found. The SPLC, on Aug 1, 2024, had tracked 2,530 Confederate monuments, while the data page only shows those with known dedicated dates, which is 1,265. They listed out the forms of honoring the Confederacy that included monuments (statues), plaques, names of places (roads, bases, schools, cities, bodies of water, etc.), songs, seals, holidays, scholarships, counties/ municipalities, flags, and even license plates. The most prominent type being monuments, with 63.95%. It also contains time charts of when they were dedicated and removed. It shows that the demand to remove them has been a recent event, but quite a few have gone down in the past. For their argument, they use this data quite well. The data they gathered had eight notable takeaways when the data was published in 2019. All valid points for the author's claim. It is the pinnacle evidence to use when discussing the Confederacy's unwillingness to accept defeat and over the Lost Cause being alive today.  However, there is a concern that what they’re trying to achieve by tracking all this data could leave them outstretched in trying to find all memorials of the Confederacy, which I’m confident they did not see all. 
The organization and communication were well done, and there was no confusion in the layout of their work. It was clear and compelling. Although the data page seems hectic at first glance, it is well organized. Every data chart was put into sections that were relevant to each other and could be expanded if you wanted to focus on each chart. The filter system on the left helps if you’re trying to find something particular, like a type of monument. This was necessary because the list of monuments was too immense to make sense of it all and would be overwhelming if it wasn’t there. Color coding what was on the charts helped see the fate of every memorial. The data page left no questions unanswered, covering all one could ask. For the article, it is straightforward, and it is sectioned off so the reader is not confused by a long read. All ended with its key takeaways in a list at the end to clearly sum things up. As for communication, it is clear. The evidence was individually dedicated. Both the qualitative data on charts and the qualitative stories make a clear argument for the audience to understand. It is clear at the beginning of the writing that their stance is that the Confederacy was not on the right side of history and should not be honored as such.  It was the SPLC that caused this data to exist at all. The extent of how many there were was a mystery, but they made it their goal to find out. That being said, there could be a bit of bias toward their research, but will personally note that such a motive doesn’t seem likely. It is an excellent source for those discussing this current debate, which is vital to understanding it more. Overall, it is an outstanding piece of data and a compelling argument.
